# Minimal Fullstack App

This is a very small project with a Node.js Express backend and a Vanilla JS frontend.

## Project Structure
- `backend/`: Express server (port 5001)
- `frontend/`: Simple web interface

## How to Run

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
```

### 2. Run the Frontend
You can simply open `frontend/index.html` in your browser, or use a live server:
```bash
cd frontend
# If you have serve installed:
npx serve .
```

The frontend is designed with modern aesthetics, including glassmorphism and smooth animations.
